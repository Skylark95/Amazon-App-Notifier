        <h2>Free App Notifier Discontinued</h2>
        <p>The Free App Of They Day has been discontinued by Amazon and has since been replaced with the announcement of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/underground" target="_blank">Amazon Underground</a>.</p>
        <p>Without a Free App Of The Day to notify you about, I am shutting down Free App Notifier For Amazon. This app may be uninstalled through <a href="market://details?id=com.skylark95.amazonfreenotify">Google Play</a>.</p>
