Bug Reports
-----------
I'll be honest and say this beta release was put together somewhat quickly due to the previous version breaking...

If you find bugs that my current scope of testing didn't seem to catch<br/>
Please email me ([derek@skylark95.com](mailto:derek@skylark95.com)) if you find any bugs or report them on the GitHub project page

Planned updates
---------------
These are updates I have planned for the future.

As I work full time and writing Android apps just a hobby of mine I try my best to<br/>
add more features but make no guarantees on the amount of time it will take for updates

* If device is offline try notification again a few times (Planned fix for showing device offline when starting the phone)
* Options to filter by more categories
* Some potential suggestions I receive from users
