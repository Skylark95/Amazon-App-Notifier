Bug Reports
-----------
I'll be honest and say this beta release was put together somewhat quickly due to the previous version breaking...

If you find bugs that my current scope of testing didn't seem to catch<br/>
Please email me ([derek@skylark95.com](mailto:derek@skylark95.com)) if you find any bugs or [report them](https://github.com/Skylark95/Amazon-App-Notifier/issues/new?labels=bug) on the GitHub project page

Planned updates
---------------
As I work full time and writing Android apps is just a hobby of mine, I'll try my best to add more features but make no guarantees on the amount of time it will take for updates

To see any ideas that I have come up with but have not implemented yet, please see the [issues section](https://github.com/Skylark95/Amazon-App-Notifier/issues) on the Github project page and look for items tagged [enhancement](https://github.com/Skylark95/Amazon-App-Notifier/issues?labels=enhancement).

You can also request features by emailing me ([derek@skylark95.com](mailto:derek@skylark95.com)) or creating a [new enhancement](https://github.com/Skylark95/Amazon-App-Notifier/issues/new?labels=enhancement).
